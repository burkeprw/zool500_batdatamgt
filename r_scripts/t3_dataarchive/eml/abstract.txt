Bat distribution and habitat use are determined by species natural history, habitat quality, climatic conditions, and seasonality. The relative importance of these contributing and potentially synergistic factors is not well known for bats using wetland and open water habitats in forested mountainious terrain in British Columbia. The purpose of acoustic bat surveys was to characterize the bat community across habitats and seasons using bioacoustic recording devices. An important survey objective was to document the presence and distribution of colony-roosting bats using robust and repeatable methods in advance of expected population declines resulting from the bat disease White-Nose Syndrome. WNS was first detected in western North America in March of 2016, less than 250 km from the sudy area in Washington state.

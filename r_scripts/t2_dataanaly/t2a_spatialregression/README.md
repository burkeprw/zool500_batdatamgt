## Task 3: Spatial Data Analysis

The purpose of this task is to model the distribution of bats across agricultural and forest habitats in the Lower Mainland of BC. This modeling will be used to estimate the value of ecosystem services (in the form of agricultural insect pest control) as part of the IAF project. This modeling will also describe baseline conditions in the ba population prior to the arrival of WNS in the province.

### Methods
I will use bat abundace collected from mobile acoustic transects to predict spatial distribution for multiple species.  

### Task Summary
This task is currently in progress. This task will support study design and strategic priority setting for bat inventory in the coming years.

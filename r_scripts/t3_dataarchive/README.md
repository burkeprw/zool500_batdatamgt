## Task 4: Data archived through the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)

The purpose of this task is to contribute to transpareny and reproducibility in science through public data archival. Data for this project is available to researchers, managers, practitioners and the general public without use restrictions at the [Environmental Data Initiative](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp). Additionally, the code and procedures for upload are provided [here](https://github.com/burkeprw/zool500_batdatamgt/blob/master/r_scripts/t3_dataarchive/01_EML_dataarchive.R) for others to use.

### Methods
The project [COA-F17-W-1211](http://fwcp.ca/project/conserving-riparian-habitats-and-species-at-risk-in-the-wahleach-watershed/) was funded by the [Fish and Widlife Compensation Program](http://fwcp.ca/), a partnership between BC Hydro, the Province of B.C., Fisheries and Oceans Canada, First Nations, and Public Stakeholders. For this project, bioacoustic data were collected to assess distribution and habitat use of bats within a 13,000 ha drainage basin in southern British Columbia. These data were then incorporated into the present analysis.

Data and metadata (the data package) for the project are archived at the [Environmental Data Initiative](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/), a [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/) Member node. The data package was written in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML), a metadata standard developed for sharing and publicizing ecological data. The data package was produced using a suport package called the `EMLassemblyline` which facilitates construction of the data package. Software and tutorials for data management can be found on the [EDIorg GitHub](https://github.com/EDIorg).

### EDI Data Policy
> The Environmental Data Initiative makes every effort to ensure that all data are curated with intellectual rights defined by the data provider as found in the data package metadata. Although EDI advocates for open and unfettered access to data packages without use restrictions, we do not forbid data providers from declaring more restrictive licensing agreements for use of their data packages. Data providers should include a statement of Intellectual Rights in the metadata of their submissions. If they do not, EDI retains the right to add a default declaration of intellectual rights to the data package metadata. The default declaration of intellectual rights used by EDI is based on the [Creative Commons CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) “No Rights Reserved” waiver

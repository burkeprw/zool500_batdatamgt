## Data Analysis

Here I explore two techniques for analysing bioacoustic data: **occupancy analysis** and **spatial regression**.   

Describe why occupancy is selected   
Models will be created in `unmarked` (Fiske and Chandler 2015)   

Describe why spatial regression is selected   
Models will be created in `package` (CITATION)

To summarize the models, we have:
